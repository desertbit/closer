// Package closer offers a simple, thread-safe closer.
//
// It allows to build up a tree of closing relationships, where you typically
// start with a root closer that branches into different children and
// children's children. When a parent closer spawns a child closer, the child
// either has a one-way or two-way connection to its parent. One-way children
// are closed when their parent closes. In addition, two-way children also close
// their parent, if they are closed themselves.
//
// A closer is also useful to ensure that certain dependencies, such as network
// connections, are reliably taken down, once the closer closes.
// In addition, a closer can be concurrently closed many times, without closing
// more than once, but still returning the errors to every caller.
//
// This allows to represent complex closing relationships and helps avoiding
// leaking goroutines, gracefully shutting down, etc.

	//
	// This method always returns the close error,
	// regardless of how often it gets called.
	//
	// The closing order looks like this:
	// 1: the closing chan is closed.
	// 2: the OnClosing funcs are executed.
	// 3: each of the closer's children is closed.
	// 4: it waits for the wait group.

	// 6: the closed chan is closed.
	// 7: the parent is closed, if it has one.
	//
	// Close blocks, until step 6 of the closing order
	// has been finished. A potential parent gets
	// closed concurrently in a new goroutine.

	// The returned error contains the joined errors of all closers that were part of
	// the blocking closing order of this closer.
